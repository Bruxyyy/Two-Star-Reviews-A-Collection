# Two Star Reviews(A Collection)
This project aims to scrape book data from (https://books.toscrape.com/) to identify and compile a list of books with a 2-star rating. The goal is to provide readers with a curated collection of books that have received mixed reviews, offering a unique perspective on popular and less-known titles.

Key Features:

Web Scraping: Utilizes Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Selenium to extract relevant data from the target website.
Data Filtering: Filters the scraped data to isolate books with a 2-star rating.
